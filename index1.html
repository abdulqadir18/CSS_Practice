  <h1>Payment Networks</h1>
  <p id="first-para">
    Let’s say you go to a store and buy a packet of biscuits. You don’t have cash on you. So you decide to whip out your debit/credit card to pay for it. You swipe the card on a PoS machine and all of a sudden a magical dance begins. Your bank starts talking to the store owner’s bank in an attempt to move money. The store owner’s bank charges a small fee for being a willing participant and calls it the merchant discount rate. But it can’t keep everything to itself. It has to share a part of these spoils with another intermediary, that helps process this payment. That intermediary happens to be Visa or Mastercard. And since the store owner has benefited from a sale, they now have to pay the bank the merchant discount rate — usually tallying up to about 1–3% of the transaction. And this, in turn, helps payment networks like Visa and Mastercard thrive in a very uncertain world.

    Take India for instance. In 2016, it built the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) to facilitate instant payments. Anyone could scan a Quick Response (QR) code and move money from one bank account to another instantaneously. And what’s even more impressive? It was free. Merchants loved it because they didn’t have to pay the extra charge. And in a high-growth market like India, Visa and Mastercard began losing a lot of money. Some estimates peg this at about Rs 6,000 crores.
