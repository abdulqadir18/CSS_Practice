      Let’s say you go to a store and buy a packet of biscuits. You don’t have cash on you. So you decide to whip out your debit/credit card to pay for it. You swipe the card on a PoS machine and all of a sudden a magical dance begins
    </li>
    <li>
      Your bank starts talking to the store owner’s bank in an attempt to move money. The store owner’s bank charges a small fee for being a willing participant and calls it the merchant discount rate. But it can’t keep everything to itself. It has to share a part of these spoils with another intermediary, that helps process this payment.
    </li>
    <li>
      That intermediary happens to be Visa or Mastercard. And since the store owner has benefited from a sale, they now have to pay the bank the merchant discount rate — usually tallying up to about 1–3% of the transaction. And this, in turn, helps payment networks like Visa and Mastercard thrive in a very uncertain world.
